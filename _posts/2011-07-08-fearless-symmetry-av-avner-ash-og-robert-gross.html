<p><a href="http://cube.fredrikmeyer.net/wp-content/uploads/fearless-symmetry.jpg"><img style="float:right" class="alignright size-full wp-image-111" title="fearless-symmetry" src="http://cube.fredrikmeyer.net/wp-content/uploads/fearless-symmetry.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="303" /></a>At a book store in a shopping center by the coast of California I found this gem of a book. I skimmed through the content list, and bought it without much more thinking. In retrospect, it is safe to say that it was worth the $23.95 plus Californian tax.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, the book is much about symmetry &nbsp;- but it is also slightly misleading. The book is really about number theory and the theory that led to the solution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem">Fermat's &nbsp;Last Theorem</a>.</p>
<p>The book's main mission is to explore the absolute <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_group">Galois group</a> $ G=\mathrm {Gal}(\mathbb Q^{alg}/\mathbb Q)$ through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)">representations</a>, that is, morphisms from $ G$ to more known groups, such as matrix groups and finite fields. As such, the book is more about representation theory than symmetry. But it doesn't stop there! A main theme in the book is how representation theory is behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_law_(mathematics)">generalized reciprocity laws</a> in number theory and how reciprocity laws are used in advanced mathematics (an example of a reciprocity law is $ (p/q)=(-1/q)(q/p)$ where $ (p/q)$ is the Legendre symbol. That is, knowing if $ p$ is square mod $ q$ tells us if $ q$ is square mod $ p$ and conversely).</p>
<p>The book is written in a leisurely language and contains no difficult proofs and avoids technical definitions - without losing substance. Number theory is presented as a rich subject with lots of tools and abstractions.</p>
<p>The presentation was very inspirational, and this next semester will be like Christmas for me.</p>
