I just got a new Macbook, and I thought it would be useful for my future self to write down what I installed on it. Luckily the history file in my shell is long enough to remember everything.

The order of the steps is quite random.

## 1. Install Homebrew

I hear there are other alternatives out there, but I stick to Brew for now.

I installed Brew the ["official"](https://brew.sh/) way:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This seemed to automatically install the [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/).

Follow the install instructions (this adds a init script to my `.zprofile` file):

```bash
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/fredrikmeyer/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## 2. Install Clojure

This installs [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [OpenJDK 21](https://adoptium.net/). From the official Clojure documentation.

```
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask temurin21
brew install leiningen
```

I do my Clojure programming in Emacs with [Cider](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/index.html) and [clojure-lsp](https://clojure-lsp.io/).

## 3. Install Emacs

I use [this](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) version of Emacs on Mac.

Install with:

```bash
brew install emacs-plus@30 --with-ctags --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-poll
osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to make alias file to posix file "/opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-plus@30/Emacs.app" at POSIX file "/Applications"'
```

The second line makes it possible to open Emacs with Finder.

My Emacs configuration is stored [here](https://github.com/FredrikMeyer/emacs.d). since I don't install on a new machine very often, usually I have to restart Emacs a few times before it works.

## 4. Install tmux

```
brew install tmux
```

I use Tmux to manage windows in my Terminal.

My Tmux configuration is Git managed. Here is the current version:

```conf
# See this https://www.seanh.cc/2020/12/27/copy-and-paste-in-tmux/
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

set -g mouse on

bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```

This first requires install the [Tmux plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm). The package `tmux-yank` makes copy on select work as expected. I wrote about [how I use Tmux here](https://fredrikmeyer.net/2023/05/31/how-i-use-tmux.html).

## 5. Install oh-my-zsh

Mostly by habit I use oh-my-zsh for terminal configuration. I'm mostly happy with the default configuration.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## 6. Install node

I do a lot of frontend development, so I will probably need to install more Node related packages, but I needed Node to let Emacs install LSP clients automatically (many of them are stored on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

```
brew install node
```

## 7. Install jotta-cli

I do a lot of my backup using [Jottacloud](https://www.jottacloud.com/nb/). They have a CLI utility to select directories to backup.

```
brew tap jotta/cli
brew install jotta-cli
brew services start jotta-cli
jotta-cli login
```

## 8. Install Rust 

From the [official documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"  # Add this line to .zshenv
```

For editor integration, also add the [language server](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/):

```
rustup component add rust-analyzer
```

## 9. Install Rectangle

I was looking for a good window manager for Mac. Spectacle is not maintained anymore (I do think it works still), but after some searching, I found [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/). Open source and easy to use.

```
brew install --cask rectangle
```

I mostly use `ctrl+option+return` to maximize windows and `ctrl+option+←`/`ctrl+option+→` to move windows to the left/right half.

## 10. Install GNU Stow

I use GNU Stow to manage (some of) my dotfiles. A good intro is [here](https://dr563105.github.io/blog/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/).

```
brew install stow
```

I keep the dotfiles in a private repository (maybe I make it public one day).

## 11. Command line utilities

I use [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) sometimes to read code files with syntax highlighting in the browser. 

And [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for fast search (also makes some Emacs plugins faster).

```
brew install bat
brew install rg
```

### Setup Git

Remember to update the Git config. At the moment mine looks like this:

```
[user]
	name = Fredrik Meyer
	email = hrmeyer@gmail.com

[core]
	editor = emacs

[github]
	user = FredrikMeyer

[init]
	defaultBranch = main
```

## 12. Install Ruby

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it needs Ruby installed.

It also uses (at the moment) an old version of Ruby, so I installed Ruby 2.7.3 with a version manager:

```
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv init
source ~/.zshrc
rbenv install --list-all
rbenv install 2.7.3
```

## 13. Apps installed other ways

That seems to be all (for now) that is installed via the CLI. I have usually also always install iTerm2, but I noticed I don't use many of its features (tabs, themes, etc?), so for now I'm sticking with the builtin Terminal app.

### Google Chrome 

It's easy and it stores all my passwords.

### Slack

For the interruptions.

### Dropbox

All my files.

### NordVPN

Sometimes I need a VPN.

### Spotify

What's life without music? (silent)

### Amazon Prime Video

The app allows downloading series.

### Remarkable Desktop App

I have the [Remarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com/), and I often use the app to upload PDF's.

### Steam

Sometimes I play games. Unfortunately, many games don't work anymore on Mac - and I might be too lazy to try installing Windows on it.
