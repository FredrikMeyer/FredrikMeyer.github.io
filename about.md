I have a PhD in algebraic geometry, but now work as a software consultant for Scienta AS.

Some keywords of skills:

 - Languages: Kotlin, Java, Python, Javascript, Clojure.
 - AWS (serverless: Lambda, S3, SQS, ...)
 - Mathematics, especially algebraic geometry.
 
On a hobby basis I also like to do programming in Clojure, making generative art and implementing geometric algorithms, see [`generert`](https://github.com/FredrikMeyer/generert/).
